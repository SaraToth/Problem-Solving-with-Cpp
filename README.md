# Problem Solving with C++

Various programs created using c++ alongside the textbook series "Problem Solving with C++" 

Each individual program is named in a #-# format and it's compiled file in a #-#-output format, where the first number is the chapter, and second number is the project number.
 
Index of projects listed below:

## Chapter 1:
- 1-1: Takes in two numbers from the user, and then outputs the sum and product of these two numbers.
- 1-2: Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of *s, followed by two blank lines and then the message "Computer science is cool stuff"
- 1-3: Write a program that allows the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes and nickels and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in cents. For example, if the user enters in 2 quarters, 3 dimes and 1 nickel the program should output the coins are worth 85 cents.
- 1-4: User enters a time in seconds, and then outputs how far an object would drop if it is in freefall for that length of time. Assume object starts from rest, there is no friction or resistance and a constant acceleration of 32 feet/second due to gravity. 
    distance = (acceleration * timeË†2) / 2
