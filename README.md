# Problem Solving with C++

Various programs created using c++ alongside the textbook series "Problem Solving with C++" 

This repository is strictly for personal practice with C++

## Note on Naming:

Each individual program is named in a #-# format and it's compiled file in a #-#-output format, where the first number is the chapter, and second number is the project number.
 

## Chapter 1:
- 1-1: Takes in two numbers from the user, and then outputs the sum and product of these two numbers.
- 1-2: Write a program that prints out "CS!" in large block letters inside a border of *s, followed by two blank lines and then the message "Computer science is cool stuff"
- 1-3: Write a program that allows the user to enter a number of quarters, dimes and nickels and then outputs the monetary value of the coins in cents. For example, if the user enters in 2 quarters, 3 dimes and 1 nickel the program should output the coins are worth 85 cents.
- 1-4: User enters a time in seconds, and then outputs how far an object would drop if it is in freefall for that length of time. Assume object starts from rest, there is no friction or resistance and a constant acceleration of 32 feet/second due to gravity. 
    distance = (acceleration * timeˆ2) / 2
- 1-5: Takes in a letter from the keyboard then outputs a block letter C made up of that letter.

## Chapter 2:
- 2-1: A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener
commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A
friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop.
Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink
without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input
to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse
(use 5 grams), the mass of the mouse (use 35 grams), and the weight of
the dieter (use 45400 grams for a 100 pound person). Assume that the
lethal dose for a mouse is proportional to the lethal dose for the human.
A single can of soda pop has a mass of 350 grams. To ensure the safety of
your friend, be sure the program requests the weight at which the dieter
will stop dieting, rather than the dieter’s current weight. Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a variable declaration
with the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to
express the percent as the double value 0.001. Your program should allow
the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.

- 2-2: Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive
for 6 months. Write a program that takes an employee’s previous annual
salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay due the employee,
the new annual salary, and the new monthly salary. Use a variable
declaration with the modifier const to express the pay increase. Your program
should allow the calculation to be repeated as often as the user wishes.
